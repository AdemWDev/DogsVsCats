# 🐶🐱 Dogs vs Cats Image Classifier

A deep learning project that classifies images as **dogs or cats** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **PyTorch** and deployed through a **Gradio web app**.

---

## 📸 Demo
Try it locally:
```bash
python deploy.py
````

Then open the Gradio interface in your browser to upload an image.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning workflow:

* Data preprocessing and augmentation
* CNN model training and validation
* Model saving and loading for inference
* Gradio interface for deployment

## 🧩 Model Architecture

The current version uses a **custom CNN** with:

* 3 convolutional layers
* ReLU activations
* MaxPooling
* Fully connected layers for binary classification

> You can easily replace it with a pretrained network (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet18) for higher accuracy.

Example snippet:

```python
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
for param in model.features.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 2)
```

---

## 📊 Training

1. Download the [Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
2. Preprocess images (resize to 128x128)
3. Run training:

   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```
4. The best model weights are saved as `model.pth`

Training logs and accuracy plots can be added under `/logs/` or `/results/`.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Launch the Gradio app:

```bash
python deploy.py
```

Upload an image — the model will predict **Dog 🐶** or **Cat 🐱**, along with its confidence score.

## 🧪 Example Predictions

| Image       | Prediction | Confidence |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 🐱 cat1.jpg | Cat 🐱     | 97.3%      |
| 🐶 dog2.jpg | Dog 🐶     | 92.5%      |

## 📈 Future Improvements

* ✅ Add pretrained model (VGG16 / ResNet18)
* ✅ Display confidence score
* 🔲 Add data augmentation
* 🔲 Integrate Streamlit / FastAPI for production
* 🔲 Optimize model size for mobile inference
